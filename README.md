# Hi there 👋
##  About me
### I am Hélène HOUPLAIN

I'm Hélène HOUPLAIN,  I'm currently studying at EPITECH Lille (2028 promotion) passionate about systems programming and full-stack development.

I enjoy building concrete, meaningful projects - from low-level C and Rust programs to modern web applications with SvelteKit.  

Currently deepening my expertise across a wide tech stack while actively looking for new challenges to grow as an engineer.
